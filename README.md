# Project 

## Robotic Hand 

I have made a robotic hand (done mostly cv work) which will copy the human human hand gestures by capturing live video either by using front camera of laptop or raspberrypi camera.


## Hardware Used:

Most of the part of the hand is made up of wood that have been cut by the help of our Carpentary workshop T.As. 

## Materials used:

I have used mainly 4 components.

- Microcontroller board (Raspberrypi zero 2W)
- Servo Motors 
- Camera 

### Raspberrypi zero 2W

Raspberrypi is a microcontroller board which acts just as a mini computer which acts as a reciever for the hardware.It also sends output to the hardware for its working.

#### The connections
 




### Servo Motors

I have used 5 Servo Motors for each finger which are connected to each finger using string 

### Camera

I have used laptop camera for the sake of simplicity but I can use raspberrypi camera or any other camera also.
